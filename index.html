                <h2>Uncommon Issues That Can Lead to Water Damage to Your Home</h2>
                <p>
                    Every homeowner should be aware of many issues other than broken pipes or faulty appliances that could result in water damage. These issues are seldom considered as potential water damage possibilities until it's too late and the damage has occurred.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of these issues are structural, and some are due to landscaping. Other issues may involve ground conditions that your home was built on. Still others can result from architectural design flaws or simply the aging of your home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Water damage is responsible for 45% of all property damage claims in the United States. As property values continue to increase, so does the cost of homeowner insurance policies. In addition, there have also been steep increases in insurance deductibles, the amount of money each homeowner must pay out before the insurance coverage kicks in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some less than obvious issues that could result in water damage to your home.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Structural Issues</li>
                    <li>Problems with Landscaping</li>
                    <li>Flaws in Design and Workmanship</li>
                    <li>Aging and Time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If you experience water damage in your home, it is important to act quickly to minimize the extent of the damage. Promptly remove any wet furnishings, rugs, or clothing from the affected area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If possible, open windows and doors to allow for air circulation. If you have a wet/dry vacuum, use it to remove as much water as possible. Place any wet books, magazines, or newspapers in plastic bags and put them in a freezer to prevent further damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have potted plants in the affected area, try to salvage them by transplanting them into smaller pots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you have taken these initial steps, contact a professional water damage restoration company to begin the cleanup and repair process.

                <h2>Structural Issues That Can Lead to Water Damage</h2>
                <p>
                    Here are a couple of structural issues that can lead to water damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Tree and Shrubbery Roots:</i> Although this can be considered a landscape issue, roots are one of the more common problems that can cause structural damage and lead to water damage. It is natural for roots to seek out water and drain lines contain water and other nutrients and oxygen that trees and shrubs need to survive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roots can exert severe pressure on foundation walls, creating cracks, and roots will grow into drainage lines, partially or entirely clogging the line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When water flow is impeded, it has to flow somewhere and usually flows back into a home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is undoubtedly the most common cause of sewer backups in homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a few ways to prevent tree roots from infiltrating your home's drainage lines. First, you can have a root barrier installed around your home. This physical barrier will keep roots from growing towards your home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another option is to use chemical root killers. These products contain chemicals that kill tree roots and prevent them from growing back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you already have tree roots in your drains, the best way to remove them is with a hydro-jetter. A hydro-jetter is a high-pressure water cleaning system that will blast away tree roots and debris, clearing your drains and restoring proper flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Changing Ground Conditions</i>: The ground your home was built on may shift. Soil expansion happens as a result of water absorption. The ground cannot compact or expand downward, so it expands upward. Then, as the moisture dries up, the ground will sink back to its original position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This upward and downward motion can stress and/or crack structural components. Cracks in walls and foundations are yet another way for unwanted water to enter a home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to the soil beneath your home shifting, the actual foundation of your home may settle. This is most likely to occur in homes with crawl spaces or basements. When the foundation settles, cracks can form in the walls or floors. These cracks can allow water to enter your home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a pool, spa, or other water feature on your property, be aware that these can also cause problems with your home's foundation. The weight of the water can cause the ground to shift and settle, leading to cracks in your home's foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, this movement can force windows and doors out of square. When this happens, windows may become "stuck", not opening and closing properly, and doors may develop gaps on either side, top, or bottom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These issues will ultimately make it easier for water to leak around the doors and windows and into your home.
                </p>
                <h2>Problems with Landscaping</h2>
                <p>
                    You may think landscaping is an outside issue that can be addressed when time permits. However, poor landscaping can lead to major problems inside your home if not corrected, especially regarding water drainage. Improper drainage can lead to water seepage in your basement or even foundation problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, poor landscaping can also attract insects and pests into your home, which can be a considerable nuisance. Landscaping is therefore not only an aesthetic issue but also a functional one that should be addressed as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Poor Grading Around Your Foundation</i>: This can be a very destructive problem. Improper landscape drainage allows water to pool alongside your home's foundation, where it will eventually work its way into your home. It can then seep into your basement and crawl space or wick its way into a slab foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can lead to the foundation's concrete cracking, damage to drywall, flooring, and finish trim, and could result in a mold infestation if steps are not taken to correct the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Sidewalks and Driveways</i>: Sometimes sidewalks and driveways, especially circular drives, are constructed without any means for water to flow across or through them. They act as a dam, trapping any water inside them or against your foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sidewalks and driveways should be designed to slope slightly away from home and have ways for any water to pass through or under them. The most common way to do this is to construct them with an expansion joint every few feet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The joint allows for a small movement between the concrete slabs and provides a space for water to pass through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your sidewalk or driveway doesn't have expansion joints, you can create them yourself by drilling 1/2-inch holes every few feet in the concrete. Be sure to wear eye protection and use a masonry bit designed for concrete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a lot of water pooling on your sidewalk or driveway, you may need to install a drainage pipe under the concrete to carry the water away from your home. However, this project is best left to a professional, as it requires excavating around your foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your sidewalk or driveway is already cracked, you can help prevent further damage by sealing the cracks. This will also help to prevent water from seeping into them and causing even more damage. Use a concrete sealer designed for cracks; don't try to use regular caulk as it won't adhere well and will peel off. Apply the sealer according to the manufacturer's instructions and wear gloves and eye protection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Flowerbeds and Trees</i>: Flowerbeds are another area that requires proper grading. When not graded in such a way as to keep water from pooling in them, the water may work its way into your home. Standing water can also damage plants and shrubs by causing root damage, shortening their life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roots are one of the more common problems when it comes to structural damage. It is natural for roots to seek out water, and drain lines contain water and other nutrients and oxygen that trees and shrubs need to survive. Roots will grow into water lines, wholly or partially clogging the line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When water flow is impeded, it has to flow somewhere and usually flows back into a home. This is undoubtedly the most common cause of building sewer backups.

                <h2>Flaws in Design and Workmanship</h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes it all comes down to human error. The builder may have made a design mistake; the wrong product may have been used for a particular situation; materials used may have been defective; workmanship may be faulty. Any of these can result in structural damage that results in water damage. What makes these flaws hard to discover is that many times the flaw doesn't become apparent until months or even years later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have suffered water damage due to someone else's negligence, you may be able to file a claim or lawsuit to recover damages. To succeed in such a case, however, you will need to prove that the other party was indeed at fault. One example of a material defect involving the main water line bringing water into your home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the 1980's, a certain type of plastic piping was used. Now this piping is degrading and creating leaks. If you have this type of waterline, your only choice is to have it dug up and replaced. But it took thirty to forty years for it to become an issue.
                </p>
                <h2>Aging and Time</h2>
                <p>
                    Let’s face it; sometimes, the reason that structural damage occurs is just a result of time or possibly delayed maintenance on your part. Everything gets old and wears out over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Floors begin to sag, and pipes deteriorate; shingles dry out and crack or are damaged by storms, brick mortar cracks. It’s natural that things get damaged or wear out over time. Like old cars and old people, buildings require repairs and maintenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chimneys leak because of cracked mortar; roofs leak because the shingles wear out; windows leak because the caulking around them dries out and leave gaps that water enters through. Some of these things can happen in as little as one season. It doesn't necessarily take 20 years for things to degrade or wear out.
                </p>
